# A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to New Mexico
### A True and Sorrowful Map-Tale by David Olivier

This is stuff that happened to me. I made it into a [story](http://slimbolala.blogspot.com/2005/05/funny-thing-happened-on-way-to-new.html). Now I'm making it into a map. Why? Because I like maps. And because it amuses me. And because perhaps it will amuse you. It is, at present, a twinkle in my eye, but it's (slowly) turning into something more. Fun, fun!
